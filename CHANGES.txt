Changes
=======

1.3 (unreleased)
----------------

* Use the grok.zope.org/releaseinfo information instead of our own
  copy of ``versions.cfg``, for easier maintenance.

* Depend on grokcore.component 2.0 and the 0.12 Martian - this changesw
  inheritance issues but doesn't appear to affect grokcore.security
  itself.

1.2 (2009-09-14)
----------------

* Changed the default permissions from grok.View to zope.View. There seems no
  particular reason not to use the standard zope.View permission defined
  in zope.app.security.

  NOTE: YOU MUST STILL ASSIGN THIS PERMISSION TO USERS IN YOUR
  site.zcml FILE. OTHERWISE YOU DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ANY VIEWS.

* Made sure to include zope.app.security configuration as well, as that
  package defines the zope.View permission. Note that in the future this will
  change to zope.security.

* Bring versions.cfg in line with grok 1.0 release candidate
  versions.cfg.


1.1 (2009-07-03)
----------------

* Changed the default permissions from zope.Public to grok.View.

  NOTE: YOU MUST ASSIGN THIS PERMISSION TO USERS IN YOUR
  site.zcml FILE. OTHERWISE YOU DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ANY VIEWS.

1.0 (2008-08-03)
----------------

* Created ``grokcore.security`` in July 2008 by factoring
  security-related components, grokkers and directives out of Grok.
