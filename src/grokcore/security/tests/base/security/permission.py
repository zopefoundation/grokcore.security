  >>> grok.testing.grok(__name__)

The permission grokker will register permissions as utilities.  That
means we can look them up again using the Component Architecture:

  >>> from zope.component import getUtility
  >>> from zope.security.interfaces import IPermission
  >>> permission = getUtility(IPermission, 'the.permission')

The permission object we obtain will actually be an instance of the
class we registered:

  >>> isinstance(permission, ThePermission)
  True

The object we obtain also complies with the ``IPermission`` interface,
meaning it has all the required attributes set.

  >>> print(permission.id)
  the.permission

  >>> print(permission.title)
  The permission!

  >>> print(permission.description)
  This is *the* permission.
